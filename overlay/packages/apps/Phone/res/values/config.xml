    <!-- If true, enable the onscreen touch UI for regular "ongoing call"
         states of the in-call UI.
         In general, the touch UI is used for regular calls only on
         devices with a proximity sensor.  (On other devices, we can't
         have touchable UI onscreen during a call because of the risk of
         false cheek touches.)
         TODO: maybe this can be determined algorithmically based on
         specific properties of the device, perhaps by detecting the
         presence of a proximity sensor and/or hard SEND/END keys.  (If
         so, we wouldn't need this flag at all.) -->
